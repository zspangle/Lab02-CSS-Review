<h1> Batman Arkham Knight, great movie, and game based off movie.</h1>
<h2>Batman has been my favorite super hero since I was a child. Both my brothers also enjoy batman and watching the anime Joker series. I dont remeber it fully, last week I found them all free online and decided to save them so I can re watch.</h2>

<h6>I also rememeber my brothers and I dressing up as Batman and Robin as kids. It was fun at the time, now that I look back at though, it seems funny!</h6>
